# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
   branches: 
    - main
    ######## Added by susanta to exclude qc and ppd branch
    - '!susgcit_qc'
    - '!susgcit_ppd'
  
   #branches: [ "susgcit_qc" ]
  #pull_request:
   # branches: [ "main" ]

  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    ######## Added by susanta to run only if the merge from ppd branch
    #if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'susgcit_ppd'

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
